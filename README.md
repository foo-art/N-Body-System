# N Body System
This project concerns about the replication of Argon gas particles in a constricted space and the investigation of the gas particles' properties with manipulation of conditions (e.g. volume, temperature).

P.s The step-by-step guide on the design of the N body system to represent the Argon gas particles are explained in ```N_body_system_code``` while the results are discussed in ```N_bod_system_report```.
